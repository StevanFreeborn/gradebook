# gradebook
This is the repository for the grade book terminal application I built for a pluralsight course.

I made this project while taking a C# course through pluralsight. It was my first exposure to C# and the .NET Framework.

This basic command line application simply allows a user to begin the program, enter grades, write those grades to a .txt file, and then quit the program and calculate some statistics for the grades that were entered.
